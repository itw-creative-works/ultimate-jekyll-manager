## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Quick boot mode (`UJ_QUICK=true`) for faster dev server startup (~5s vs ~20s) by skipping clean, slow setup operations, and deferring webpack/sass compilation until after Jekyll's first build

### Changed
- Add `onsubmit="return false"` to all JS-managed forms as a safety net against native submission before FormManager loads
- Checkout payment method buttons start hidden and are revealed via `data-wm-bind` when payment methods load
- Remove development-only guard from click prevention logging in body.html

### Fixed
- Add dev-only artificial pre-delay support to checkout page for testing form protection timing
