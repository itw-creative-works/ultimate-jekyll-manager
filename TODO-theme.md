> Im going to have you build a custom bootstrap theme. We are using bootstrap 5.3.1.

  The theme is called Classy, you can make your changes to "src/assets/themes/classy/_theme.scss"


  The theme is a simple, yet modern, clean, and elegant design suitable for various types of websites, but
  witha primary focus on modern tech, AI, and marketing.

  I've attached some screenshots of the design for reference, go crazy and make it SUPER SEXY!

  notice how when you scroll, the top bar stays withy ou and also shrinks a little\

  Since we're using bootstrap, DO NOT MAKE CUSTOM CSS FOR ANYTHING UNLESS ABSOILUTELY NECESSARY. Obviously,
  you can make it for the visual changes but DO NOT REINVENT THE WHEEL!
