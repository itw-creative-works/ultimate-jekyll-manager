Hey there, I'm Marcus!

Design has always been my way of solving problems. With a Master's in Human-Computer Interaction from Carnegie Mellon and 7 years of product design experience, I've learned that great design is invisible - it just works.

Before joining the team, I led design at a health-tech startup where I redesigned their patient portal, increasing user satisfaction by 40%. That experience taught me the power of user research and iterative design.

I'm passionate about building design systems that scale and mentoring junior designers. Outside of work, I'm an amateur street photographer and have an ever-growing collection of jazz vinyl. You might also catch me on the trails around Austin on my gravel bike.
