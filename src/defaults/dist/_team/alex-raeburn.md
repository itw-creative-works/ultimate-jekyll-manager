Hey everyone, I'm Alex!

I was born and raised in Beverly Hills, CA, where the intersection of creativity and culture shaped who I am today. Writing and technology have always been important parts of my life, and I'm thrilled to bring that passion to this team.

As Social Media Manager, I oversee our brand's presence across all platforms and contribute regularly to our blog. I believe social media is more than just posting content - it's about building genuine connections with our community and telling stories that resonate with people.

Before joining the team, I worked at a boutique marketing agency where I managed accounts for lifestyle brands and influencers. That experience taught me the power of authentic engagement and how the right content at the right time can spark real conversations.

I'm fascinated by how technology is transforming the way we communicate. The idea that tools and automation can help us be more present and creative (rather than bogged down in repetitive tasks) really excites me. It's why I love working on products that empower people to do more with less effort.

Outside of work, you'll find me curating my Instagram feed - it's become a creative outlet where I experiment with photography and storytelling. I also love exploring LA's food scene and discovering hidden gems to share with my followers.
