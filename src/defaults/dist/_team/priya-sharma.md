Hi there, I'm Priya!

I'm passionate about helping customers succeed. After 5 years in management consulting at Deloitte, I realized my favorite part of the job was working directly with clients to solve their problems. That's what led me to customer success.

In my role, I'm the voice of the customer within our company. I work closely with our users to understand their needs, help them get the most out of our products, and bring their feedback to our product and engineering teams.

I believe that customer success isn't just about solving problems - it's about building relationships and truly understanding what our users are trying to achieve. Every customer interaction is an opportunity to learn and improve.

When I'm not on calls with customers, I teach yoga classes at a local community center and volunteer with a nonprofit that provides tech education to underserved youth. I'm also a podcast addict - always happy to share recommendations!
