Hola! I'm Sarah.

Marketing is storytelling backed by data, and I love both equally. With 8 years in growth marketing, I've helped startups find their voice and reach the customers who need them most.

I started my career at a digital agency in New York before catching the startup bug. Since then, I've been hooked on the energy of building something from the ground up. I joined the team to build a world-class marketing engine and tell our story to the world.

My approach combines creative brand-building with rigorous analytics. I believe every marketing dollar should be accountable, but that doesn't mean we can't have fun along the way.

When I'm not optimizing funnels or crafting campaigns, you'll find me on the dance floor - I've been doing salsa for over 10 years. I also have a goal to visit 50 countries before 40 (currently at 34!).
