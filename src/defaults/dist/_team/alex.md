Hey everyone, I'm Alex. I was born and raised in Beverly Hills, CA. Writing and technology have always been an important part of my life and I'm excited to be a part of this project.

I love the idea of a social media bot and how it can make our lives easier.

I also enjoy tending to my Instagram. It's very important to me.
