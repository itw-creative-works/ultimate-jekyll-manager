Hey, I'm Rare!

I'm a multi-disciplinary content creator with a passion for visual storytelling. From short-form TikToks to long-form YouTube videos, I love crafting content that connects with people on an emotional level.

Before going in-house, I built my own following as an independent creator, which taught me what resonates with audiences and how to stay authentic while meeting brand goals. I studied film at NYU and worked at a creative agency before joining the team.

My role spans everything creative - shooting and editing videos, designing graphics for social, writing scripts, and constantly experimenting with new formats and platforms. I believe the best content comes from genuine curiosity and a willingness to try things that might not work.

When I'm not behind a camera or in Premiere Pro, you'll find me hunting for vintage gems at Brooklyn thrift stores, shooting 35mm film around the city, or DJing at local venues. Always looking for the next creative spark!
