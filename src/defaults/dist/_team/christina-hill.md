Hey there, I'm Christina!

I'm passionate about bringing people together and creating spaces where our users can connect, learn, and grow. There's nothing quite like seeing a community member help another one out - that's when you know you've built something special.

Before joining the team, I managed online communities for a gaming company and a nonprofit organization. Those experiences taught me that every community is unique, and the best ones are built on genuine relationships rather than metrics.

My role spans everything from moderating discussions and organizing virtual events to writing blog posts and gathering feedback from our users. I love being the bridge between our community and the rest of the team - making sure user voices are heard and celebrated.

When I'm not online engaging with our community, you'll find me curled up with a good book, exploring the Pacific Northwest trails, or hosting board game nights with friends. I firmly believe that the best ideas come from diverse perspectives coming together.
