Hey there, I'm Alfred!

I bring a wealth of technical expertise and leadership to our team. With a background in computer science from Stanford University, I've spent over 8 years building scalable web applications and leading engineering teams at several tech startups before joining this incredible team.

My journey into software development started in high school when I built my first website. That spark turned into a full-blown obsession with understanding how things work under the hood. I love diving deep into complex systems and finding elegant solutions that stand the test of time.

As Lead Developer, I'm passionate about clean code, best practices, and establishing development standards that help the entire team succeed. I believe great software is built by great teams, so mentorship and knowledge sharing are core to how I work. There's nothing more rewarding than watching a junior developer have that "aha" moment.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me contributing to open-source projects - I believe in giving back to the community that taught me so much. I'm also an avid chess player (always looking for a worthy opponent!) and love exploring the hiking trails around the Bay Area. There's something about being in nature that helps me think through tough technical problems.

I'm excited to be part of this team and can't wait to see what we build together.
