Hey everyone, I'm Ian.

I'm an innovative business owner and electronic music artist from Los Angeles, CA.

I quit the corporate 9-5 lifestyle in 2017 to embark on my risky yet rewarding entrepreneurial journey. Today, I work for myself building projects I'm passionate about. I'm proud to say that millions of people now use my creations to enhance their productivity and innovation.
