Hey everyone, I'm Ian!

I'm an innovative business owner and electronic music artist from Los Angeles, CA. Technology and creativity have always driven me - whether I'm building software or producing electronic beats.

I quit the corporate 9-5 lifestyle in 2017 to embark on my risky yet rewarding entrepreneurial journey. After years of working in traditional tech roles, I realized I wanted to create things that truly mattered to me. Taking that leap was terrifying, but it turned out to be the best decision I ever made.

Today, I work for myself building projects I'm passionate about. I'm proud to say that millions of people now use my creations to enhance their productivity and innovation. From browser extensions to web applications, I love solving problems that make people's lives a little easier.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me in my home studio producing electronic music under my artist name. Music has been a lifelong passion - it's the perfect creative outlet that balances the logical side of software development. There's something magical about crafting sounds and melodies that move people.

I believe in building things that last and treating users with respect. No dark patterns, no shady practices - just honest products that deliver real value. That philosophy has guided every project I've built, and I'm excited to continue this journey.
