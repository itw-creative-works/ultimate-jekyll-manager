Hey! I'm James.

I've been in B2B sales for over 8 years, and what I love most is helping businesses find solutions that genuinely make their lives easier. I'm not about the hard sell - I believe in understanding what customers actually need and being honest about whether we're the right fit.

Before joining the team, I was at a SaaS company in the HR tech space where I consistently exceeded quota and helped train new sales reps. When I saw the opportunity to join an early-stage startup and build a sales function from the ground up, I jumped at it.

I've helped develop our sales playbook, demo scripts, and qualification criteria. I work closely with our marketing and product teams to make sure we're telling a consistent story and learning from every customer interaction.

Outside of work, I'm a die-hard Boston sports fan (go Celtics!) and spend my weekends on the golf course trying to break 80. I also love to cook - my Sunday sauce recipe has been passed down for three generations.
