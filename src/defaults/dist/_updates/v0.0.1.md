## What's new

We're excited to announce version 2.0.0, our biggest update yet! This release includes a complete visual redesign, dark mode support, and significant performance improvements.

### Performance improvements

We've optimized the entire codebase for speed:

- **50% faster** page load times
- Reduced bundle size by 30%
- Improved caching strategies
- Lazy loading for images and components

### New user interface

The entire UI has been redesigned with a focus on usability:

- Cleaner, more modern design
- Improved navigation
- Better mobile responsiveness
- Accessibility improvements

## Breaking changes

- Minimum supported browser versions have been updated
- Some deprecated API endpoints have been removed
- Configuration file format has changed (see migration guide)
